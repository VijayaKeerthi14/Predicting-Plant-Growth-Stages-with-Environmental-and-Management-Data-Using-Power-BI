# Predicting-Plant-Growth-Stages-with-Environmental-and-Management-Data-Using-Power-BI
Project Description:

XYZ Company, renowned for its innovative approach in agriculture, is embarking on a project to optimize plant growth through advanced data analytics and visualization techniques using Power BI. The project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing key environmental and management factors such as soil type, sunlight hours, water frequency, fertilizer type, temperature, and humidity. By leveraging this data, the company aims to predict the growth milestones of plants, which are crucial for understanding the conditions that promote optimal growth. This project will involve the creation of interactive dashboards and predictive models to uncover patterns and insights that can inform and improve agricultural practices and greenhouse management.



The analysis will be conducted using a decomposition tree to break down growth milestone counts by various factors, providing a clear view of the impact of each variable. Additionally, the project will include the development of several calculated columns and measures to enhance the dataset's analytical depth. Visualizations such as clustered bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and column charts will be utilized to present the findings effectively. By implementing this solution, XYZ Company aims to enhance crop yields, optimize resource allocation, and promote sustainable agricultural practices, ultimately solidifying its position as a leader in agricultural innovation.




Scenario 1: 

ABC Greenhouses has been facing challenges with inconsistent plant growth across its different greenhouse locations. By leveraging Power BI, the company plans to identify the best combination of soil type, sunlight hours, and watering frequency that leads to the highest growth milestones. The decomposition tree will help break down growth milestone counts by these factors, revealing that loam soil combined with daily watering and 6-8 hours of sunlight yields the best results. This insight will enable ABC Greenhouses to standardize these conditions across all locations, improving overall plant health and productivity.



Scenario 2:

GreenEarth Farms has noticed varying growth rates in their organic crops and wants to ensure consistency in their yield. By analyzing the dataset, the company discovers that organic fertilizer combined with loam soil and bi-weekly watering leads to the most significant growth milestones. The decomposition tree further reveals that maintaining temperatures between 20-30Â°C and humidity levels between 50-70% optimizes plant growth. GreenEarth Farms will use these insights to adjust their farming practices, ensuring their crops achieve the best possible growth under organic farming conditions.



Scenario 3: 

FutureGrow Tech has been developing smart farming solutions but needs to validate their technology's effectiveness under different conditions. By using Power BI to analyze the dataset, the company identifies that their smart sensors for monitoring soil moisture and adjusting water frequency in real-time significantly improve growth milestones. The decomposition tree analysis reveals that these sensors work best with sandy soil and weekly organic fertilizer application, under moderate temperature and humidity conditions. FutureGrow Tech will integrate these findings into their product development, enhancing their technology to offer precise and effective agricultural solutions.
